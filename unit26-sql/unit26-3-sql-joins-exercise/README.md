# SQL Joins Exercise
## Part One: Getting Started
Letâ€™s start with the following sql file called data.sql.

Seed data.sql, and first, take a look at the SQL in that database and make sure you understand what it is doing.

Write the following SQL commands to produce the necessary output:
- Join the two tables so that every column and record appears, regardless of if there is not an owner_id.
- Count the number of cars for each owner. Display the owners first_name, last_name and count of vehicles. The first_name should be ordered in ascending order.
- Count the number of cars for each owner and display the average price for each of the cars as integers. Display the owners first_name, last_name, average price and count of vehicles. The first_name should be ordered in descending order. Only display results with more than one vehicle and an average price greater than 10000.
