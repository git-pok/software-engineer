# React Router Dog Finder
Build an app that routes to different dogs and displays information on that dog when you’re at that route.

The routes should look like this:
- /dogs is the homepage and shows all three dogs
- Clicking on a dog from the homepage takes you to that dog’s route. For example, clicking on Whiskey will take you to /dogs/whiskey.
- every other endpoint not listed should redirect you to /dogs.
## Recommended Structure
The <App /> should render:
- a <Nav /> component with the dogs’ names passed as props
- a <Switch> with your <Route /> declarations

Here is an Example Snippet from the render method of <App /> To Get You Started:
```
return (
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path="/dogs" >
      <DogList /> // what props will this need?
    </Route>
    <Route path="/dogs/:name" >
      <DogDetails /> // what props will this need?
    </Route>
    <Redirect to="/dogs" />
  </Switch>
);
```
In this example:
- <DogList /> takes all the dog info from the props of <App />
- <DogDetails /> shows all of the info about a single dog
- In <DogDetails />, how will you derive the current dog, e.g. whiskey?
- Bonus: is there a way to get the current dog before you render the component, passing dog instead of the entire list of dog data?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
