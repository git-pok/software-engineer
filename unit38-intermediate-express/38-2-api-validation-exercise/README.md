# Express Bookstore
For this exercise, you will build an express.js application that validates a resource and then add tests to the application.

## Code I Added
The codde I added to each file is commented.

## Getting started
You will be adding validation to an application that stores one resource, books. Here is an example of what a book object should look like:
```
{
  "isbn": "0691161518",
  "amazon_url": "http://a.co/eobPtX2",
  "author": "Matthew Lane",
  "language": "english",
  "pages": 264,
  "publisher": "Princeton University Press",
  "title": "Power-Up: Unlocking the Hidden Mathematics in Video Games",
  "year": 2017
}
```

Your application currently consists of the following routes:
GET /books:
- Responds with a list of all the books

POST /books:
- Creates a book and responds with the newly created book

GET /books/[isbn]:
- Responds with a single book found by its isbn

PUT /books/[isbn]:
- Updates a book and responds with the updated book

DELETE /books/[isbn]:
- Deletes a book and responds with a message of “Book deleted”

## Part One - Getting Started + Adding Validation
Before you get started, read through the code to make sure you understand what’s going on here.

Create your database and then run the data.sql file.

Use JSONSchema to validate the creation and updating of your books! Display an error message containing all of the validation errors if book creation or updating fails.

## Part Two - Add Tests
Add integration tests for each of your routes to make sure that the response expected is sent.

Think about certain edge cases for each of these routes and add tests for things like invalid input to make sure your schema validation is correct.
