BUG 1 FIXED
// Show a default image if the show has no image.

BUG 2 FIXED
// When a user searches a show, the show appears in the DOM.
// Let's say the user hits the Episodes button,
// then searches another show.
// The episodes from the previously searched show,
// would be in the new searched shows episodes lists.
